# Anti-Aliasing Filters

This repository is my attempt at reproducing the results in [this](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6473915) paper by Rachid et al on a new type of anti-aliasing filter that uses aliasing itself to filter out the image frequencies produced when sampled by an ADC. I did this under the guidance of Prof. Shanthi Pavan, first reproducing the results using the method the authors did, and then using the Parks-McClellan algorithm to solve the same optimisation problem in the time domain, obtaining very similar results. 

A more detailed explanation of the paper and my method and results is present in the PDF report in this repo.
